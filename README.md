# React - Todo app - Sample Code
## Spring 2022

Here is sample code that is not by far ideal.

I plan to rebuild this based on React Vite 2.0 tool in the future.

It also needs to add backend support, input validation, and a lot of code changes.

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

You may serve it with a static server:

###  `npm install -g serve` \
###  `serve -s build`
